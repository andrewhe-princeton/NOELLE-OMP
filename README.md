This project leverages NOELLE (NOELLE Offers Empowering LLVM Extensions) to develop and implement advanced code optimizations targeting LLVM IR. NOELLE provides powerful abstractions that simplify the creation of complex code analyses and transformations.

Key aspects of this project include:
- Utilizing NOELLE's abstractions to implement custom optimization passes
- Exploring program dependence graphs (PDG) and other NOELLE-provided data structures
- Developing optimizations that target wide program scopes
- Comparing the effectiveness of NOELLE-based optimizations to traditional compiler optimizations


Prerequisites
- LLVM 14.0.6
- NOELLE (version 14.1.0 or later)
- C++ compiler with C++17 support
