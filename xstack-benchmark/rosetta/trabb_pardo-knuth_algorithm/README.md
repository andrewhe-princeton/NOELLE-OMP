The task is to implement the algorithm:

1. Use the function:     {\displaystyle f(x)=|x|^{0.5}+5x^{3}}
2. The overflow condition is an answer of greater than 400.
3. The 'user alert' should not stop processing of other items of the sequence.
4. Print a prompt before accepting eleven, textual, numeric inputs.
5. You may optionally print the item as well as its associated result, but the results must be in reverse order of input.
6. The sequence   S   may be 'implied' and so not shown explicitly.
7. Print and show the program in action from a typical run here. (If the output is graphical rather than text then either add a screendump or describe textually what is displayed).
