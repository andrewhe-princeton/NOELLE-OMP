Charles Babbage, looking ahead to the sorts of problems his Analytical Engine would be able to solve, gave this example:

What is the smallest positive integer whose square ends in the digits 269,696?
â€” Babbage, letter to Lord Bowden, 1837; see Hollingdale and Tootill, Electronic Computers, second edition, 1970, p. 125.

He thought the answer might be 99,736, whose square is 9,947,269,696; but he couldn't be certain.
