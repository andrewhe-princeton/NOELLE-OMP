This code should be able to write a file to magnetic tape.
The Wikipedia page on Magnetic tape data storage shows that magnetic tapes are still in use.
In fact, the latest format, at the time of writing this code is TS1155 released in 2017.
And since C is already 44, maybe 45, years old in 2017, I am sure someone somewhere did use a C compiler on magnetic tapes.
If you happen to have one, please try to compile and execute me on that system.
My creator tested me on an i5 machine with SSD and RAM that couldn't have even been dreamt of by Denis Ritchie.
Who knows ? Maybe he did foresee today, after all he created something which is still young after 44-45 years and counting...
